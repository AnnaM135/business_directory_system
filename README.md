Create a class hierarchy which represents the organizations, their different categories (Fund, NGO, LLC, CJSC, ...) and sub-categories, like retail, education, services, etc. Research the situation in the world to complete this task. Try to add as many important details as possible to build a business directory system. Create instances of the classes (certain organizations) and initialize them appropriately. Think about polymorphism in your system and mark the methods which are applicable in an appropriate way and override in child classes.
